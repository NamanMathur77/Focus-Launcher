# Clair 🌱

**Clair** is a minimal Android launcher designed to reduce distraction and help you focus on what truly matters.

Instead of aggressively blocking apps or forcing restrictions, Clair uses **psychological simplicity and calm design** to gently guide you away from distractions.

This project is currently in **early MVP** and moving into testing.

## ✨ Why Clair?

Most launchers fight distraction by:
- Blocking apps  
- Adding strict limits  
- Creating friction through rules  

Clair takes a different approach.

It believes that **a calm environment naturally leads to better focus**.

No pressure.  
No force.  
Just less noise.
